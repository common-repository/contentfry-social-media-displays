Embed contentfry displays into your WordPress posts with just a few clicks.

== Description ==
With contentfry you can bring content from multiple social media networks onto your own website. You can collect user’s photos, videos and texts as well as your own postings and display them in a customizable social media feed.

To use the contentfry plugin you must have an account on [contentfry.com](https://contentfry.com/), where you can create and customize your display. It is also where you can manage your sources and curate your content. This plugin makes it very easy for you to embed your contentfry display to WordPress.

* Contentfry collects social content from multiple social platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Linkedin, Flickr, Tumblr and RSS. 
* It’s easy to customize your displays with our powerful style editor: you can choose from different display types and styles and further customize backgrounds, fonts, colors, etc. 
* The different display types to choose from include: “Grid” (the classic Social Wall), “Squares” (for the prettiest images), “Timeline” (the Social Wall with news character), “Slider” (the space saver) and a “Slideshow” 
* The moderation tool gives you full control over the content on your website. You can decide for each source if posts should be displayed straight away or if you would like to moderate them beforehand.
* Further curate your content by using Storyboxes and Themes. With a Storybox you can display manually selected posts in a defined order. With Themes you can automatically sort your content into subjects by using filters. 
* The displays are completely responsive and mobile-ready.
